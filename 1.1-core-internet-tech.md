# Internet Protocols

IP addresses are like the addresses for the postal service.
There are 2 version IPv4 IPv6
IPv4 address contains 4 octet separated by periods or dots. eg. 192.0.2.235.
IPv6 address contains 8 groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons. eg. 4527:0a00:1567:0200:ff00:0042:8329.

An internet protocol contains the to IP address and the from IP address. As well as TCP - Transmission Control Protocol and UDP - User Datagram Protocol.
TCP is used to send data that must arrive with out data loss and in order.
UDP is used to send data that can tolerate data lost like video or voice calls.

# HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's how we communicate with a web server. A Request-response protocol.

A HTTP request consists of a method, path, version and headers.
Method is GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
Path is the where the resource is stored on the web server.
Version is HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.
Headers contain information about the request and the client making the request.

Response will contain similar things to the request as well as a message body.
The status code will tell us if the request was a success.
There 5 types of status codes:

- Informational: 100-199, interim before the actual response, most common is 100 'continue'
- Successful: 200 to 299, http method (get,post,put,delete) was successful, most common 200 OK.
- Redirection: 300 to 399, tells the client the resource has moved, most common 301 and 302, 302 being temporary.
- Client error: 400 to 499, the request contained bad syntax or content. Most common 400 bad data, 401 user must login, 403 request was invalid eg. insufficient permissions, 404 resource not found.
- Server error: 500 to 599, error on the server. Most common 500 internal error failed to process.

## HTTPS

Operations the same http only before request is sent the data gets turned into a secret code. only the other computer can turn it back.

# Intro to HTML, CSS, Javascript

Webpages are made of html, css, js.

HTML is the structure.
CSS is the style.
JS is interactive elements.

Js can make a page interactive by adding listeners

# Other Internet Protocols

Dynamic Host Configuration PRotocol (DHCP) - When your computer connects to a network the DHCP assigns your computer an IP.

Domain Name System Protocol (DNS) - Your computer check the DNS server to find the IP address of the computer that is associated with a domain name.

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - Is used to check emails and manage your mailbox.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) - This allows your client to send emails via an SMTP server.

Post Office Protocol (POP) - Older protocol used to download emails, deleting email off the server once downloaded.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - Allows you to send and receive files for a server.

Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) - A way to log in to interact with a server.

SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) - Send file securely over the SSH protocol.

# Webpages, Websites, Web Apps

A web site is informative.
A web app in interactive.

# Dev Tools

I skipped this one... ( right-click > inspect )

# Frameworks and libraries

Things to build faster.

Library are reusable and provide a specific function.
Framework provide structure to build with. Frameworks can also use Libraries.
Libraries are considers not opinionated, frameworks are.

# APIs and services

Application Programming Interface. Often the bridge between systems.
One common type of API is the browser or Web APIs which are built into the browser itself.
An example is the DOM API, the DOM API turn the html doc into a tree of nodes that used by javascript.
Or Geo API, Fetch API, Canvas API or REST API.
The most common for web developer is a REST API.
The contain endpoints and return json.

# IDE

Integrated development environment is software to build an application.
It contains tools like code editor, terminal/console, debugger, syntax highlighting.
