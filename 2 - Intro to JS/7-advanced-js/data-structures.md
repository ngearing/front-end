# Data Structures

**Strings**
`const grades = "50,60,70,80,90,100";`

**Numbers**
`const grade1 = 50;`

**Arrays**
Arrays are ordered collection of values. You use arrays when you need to store values and access them later under an index.
`const grades = [50,60,70,80,90,100];`

**Objects**
Objects are unaltered, non-iterable collection of key value pairs. You use objects when you want to store data under a variable to use later. You use objects when you write OOP code.
`const grades = {grade1: 50, grade2: 60, grade: 70}`

**Map**
Map is like an Array because it is iterable. However, unlike arrays, the Map object holds key-value pairs. With maps any value can be used as a key. With objects, keys can only be strings or symbols.
`const map = new Map();`
