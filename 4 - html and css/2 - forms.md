Forms capture user input and allow you to validate the data before processing it.
There are various types of form inputs that can be used like:

- Button (Submits a form)

- Radio (Lets users choose only one option from a list)
- Select (A drop down menu for selecting an option)

<input type="email" name="email">
<button type="submit">Sign Up</button>

</form>`;

## Client side validation

Using html and css we can guide users to enter the correct data of forms.
To ensure that users provide value to the filled and to save on server requests we can use the `required` attribute to inform the user that the form is empty.

We can also use the `minlength` and `maxlength` attributes to ensure users enter correct length values.

And then we can use css to invalid fields. `input:invalid`.

`min` and `max` attributes can be used to limit the range of acceptable values.

`multiple` indicates that the user can enter more than one value in a single field. This attribute is supported in `<select>`, `<input>`, and `<textarea>` elements.

`pattern` attribute allows us to specify a regular expression pattern that the inputâ€™s value must match in order for it to pass validation. Handy for telephone fields.
